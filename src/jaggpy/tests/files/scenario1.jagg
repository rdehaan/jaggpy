# (see Example 2.1 on page 697)

# The following four propositional variables appear
x1, x2, x3, x4

# There are four issues
4
# The four issues are identified with these formulas
1, x1
2, x2
3, x3
4, x4

# The input constraints and the output constraints (they are the same)
In, (~x1 | ~x2 | ~x3) & (~x1 | ~x3 | ~x4)
Out, (~x1 | ~x2 | ~x3) & (~x1 | ~x3 | ~x4)

# We have 11 voters with 4 different judgment sets
11, 4
# List the judgment sets together with how often they occur in the profile
3, 2;3;4
1, 1;2
3, 1;2;4
4, 1;3
